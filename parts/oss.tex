\cvsection{Talks, articles \& Open source}

\begin{cvparagraph}
  I love to share my knowledge in many ways, especially in conferences. I spoke in various sessions, such as Paris Web, SudWeb, BlendWebMix, Kiwipartÿ, TakeOff Conf… My talks are available \href{https://github.com/m4dz/talks/tree/gh-pages}{online}, and mainly speak about quality, JavaScript, frameworks, accessibility and cryptography.
  I also write articles in my notes and for some other platforms, like \href{http://openweb.eu.org/}{OpenWeb group} and the \href{https://blog.clever-age.com/}{Clever Age blog}.
  I collaborate on various OSS projects, like Brunch.io, Oh-My-ZSH, BrowserSync and others. I also wrote some JS polyfills.
  I wouldn't be mad if I didn't have another cool project, so I'm currently writing a book called Browser as a platform: unleash the power of strong webapps. It tries to give a solution to the huge and unmaintainable large codebases, especially when you work with multiple developers, across distributed teams. I hope the book can be one day finished.
